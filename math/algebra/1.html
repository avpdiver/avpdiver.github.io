                    Let $a,b$ be integers, with $b\ne0$. 
                    Then there exist a unique $q\in\mathbb{Z}$ and a unique $r\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $a=bq+r$ with $0\le{r}\lt|b|$.
                </section>
                <section class="proof">
                    <i>Proof.</i><br>
                    We can assume that $b\gt{0}$.<br>
                    Indeed, if $b\lt{0}$, we can apply the statement to $-b\gt{0}$ and then flip the sign of $q$ after the fact. 
                    Switching the sign of $b$ does not change $|b|$, so the condition on $r$ is unchanged.<br>
                    Assume then that $b\gt{0}$, and consider all integer linear combinations of $a$ and $b$ of the form $a-bx$ with $x\in\mathbb{Z}$. 
                    Note that there are nonnegative integers of this type: if $a$ is itself nonnegative, then $a-b\cdot0=a$ is nonnegative; 
                    and if $a$ is negative, then $a-ba=a(1-b)$ is nonnegative because $1-b\le0$. 
                    Therefore, the set $$S=\{a-bx\ |\ x\in\mathbb{Z}: a-bx\ge0\}$$ is a nonempty set of nonnegative integers.<br>
                    By the well-ordering principle, it contains a least element $r$: 
                    that is, there is some $x=q$ such that $r=a-bq\ge0$ is smaller than any other nonnegative number of the form $a-bx$. 
                    And these $q$ and $r$ are the unique numbers whose existence is claimed in the statement.<br>
                    Indeed: by construction we have that $a=bq+r$ and that $r\ge0$; 
                    we have to verify that (1) $r\lt{b}$ (note that $|b|=b$ since we are assuming $b\gt0$) and 
                    (2) the numbers $q$ and $r$ are unique with these properties.<br>
                    For (1), argue by contradiction. If we had $r\ge{b}$, then we would have $r-b\ge0$; and $$0\le{r-b}=(a-bq)-b=a-b(q+1).$$
                    This would show that $r-b$ is an element of $S$, since it is a nonnegative integer linear combination of $a$ and $b$. 
                    But that is a contradiction, since $r-b\lt{r}$ while $r$ was chosen to be the least element of $S$. 
                    Since $r\ge{b}$ leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that $r\lt{b}$ as we claimed.<br>
                    For (2), assume that $q',r'$ are also integers satisfying the requirement spelled out in the theorem: 
                    that is, $a=bq'+r'$, and $0\le{r'}\lt{b}$. 
                    We will show that necessarily $q'=q$ and $r'=r$ (this is what we mean by stating that $q$ and $r$ are <b>unique</b>).<br>
                    Since $a=bq+r=bq'+r'$, we have $$b(q-q')=r'-r.\qquad\qquad\qquad(1.1)$$<br>
                    Now, since both $r$ and $r'$ are in the interval $[0, b-1]$, their difference cannot exceed $b-1$. 
                    In other words, $|r'-r|\le{b-1}$, and in particular $|r'-r|\lt|b|$. 
                    But (1.1) shows that $b$ is a divisor of $r'-r$; if $r'-r\ne0$, then by Lemma 1.2 we would necessarily have 
                    $|b|\le|r'-r|$, contradicting the fact that $|b|>|r'-r|$ we observed a moment ago. 
                    The only possibility then is that $r'-r=0$. This shows that $r'=r$, and further $b(q-q')=0$. 
                    Since $b\ne0$, this implies that $q-q'=0$, and it follows that $q'=q$.

                    <b>DEFINITION 1.5. Greatest common divisor.</b><br>
                    Let $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$. We say that a nonnegative integer $d$ is the <b>greatest common divisor</b> of $a$ and $b$, 
                    denoted $gcd(a, b)$ or simply $(a, b)$, if:<br>
                    (i) $d | a$ and $d | b$;<br>
                    (ii) if $c | a$ and $c | b$, then $c | d$.
                </section>
                
                <br>

                <section>
                    If at least one of $a$ and $b$ is not $0$, then $d = gcd(a, b)\ne 0$. 
                    Indeed, $d$ must divide both $a$ and $b$ according to the requirement (i) in the definition 
                    (this makes $d$ a <b>common divisor</b>), so $d$ cannot be $0$ unless both $a$ and $b$ are $0$ 
                    - keep in mind that $0$ only divides $0$.
                    <br>
                    The requirement (ii) in the definition says that if $c$ is also a common divisor, then it 
                    must divide $d$. By <a href="#lemma1.2">Lemma 1.2</a>, this implies that $|c|\le|d|$ if $d\ne 0$, and hence $c\le{d}$ since 
                    $d$ is nonnegative. Therefore $d$ is the <b>greatest</b> (as in <b>largest</b>) common divisor of 
                    $a$ and $b$ if $a$ and $b$ are not both $0$.
                    <br>
                    Why requirement (ii) is not something like:<br>
                    (ii) if $c | a$ and $c | b$, then $c\le{d}$,<br>
                    which would seem to justify the terminology <b>greatest common divisor</b> in a more direct way. 
                    The main reason is that when we recast this notion for more general <b>rings</b>, 
                    the relation of divisibility will be available, while the (perhaps) simpler relation $\le$ will not. 
                    Also, Definition 1.5 makes good sense for all possible integers $a, b$, including the case $a = b = 0$: 
                    in this case, since every number divides $0$, the second requirement says that every integer should divide $gcd(0, 0)$. 
                    Since $0$ is the only number divisible by every integer, this tells us that $gcd(0, 0) = 0$ according to Definition 1.5. 
                    Even in this case, $gcd(a, b)$ is <b>greatest</b>; 
                    but with respect to the divisibility relation rather than the ordinary order relation $\le$.

                    Let $a,b$ be integers. Then the greatest common divisor $d = gcd(a, b)$ is an integer linear combination of $a$ and $b$. 
                    That is, there exist integers $m$ and $n$ such that $d = ma + nb$.<br>
                    In fact, if $a$ and $b$ are not both $0$, then $gcd(a, b)$ is the smallest positive linear combination of $a$ and $b$.
                </section>
                <section class="proof">
                    <i>Proof.</i><br>
                    If $a = b = 0$, then $gcd(a, b) = gcd(0, 0) = 0$, which is a linear 
                    combination of $a$ and $b$ (because $0 = 1 · 0 + 1 · 0$). Therefore, we may assume that 
                    $a$ and $b$ are not both $0$. Consider all linear combinations $ma + nb$ of $a$ and $b$. 
                    I claim that some of them are positive. Indeed, take $m = a, n = b$; then $ma + nb = a^2 + b^2$ , and this 
                    number is positive since $a$ and $b$ are not both $0$.
                    <br>
                    Therefore, the set $$S = \{ma + nb\ |\ m\in\mathbb{Z}, n\in\mathbb{Z}, ma + nb \gt 0\}$$
                    is nonempty. This is the standard setting to apply the well-ordering principle: since $S$ 
                    is a nonempty set of nonnegative integers, it must have a least element. Let $d$ be this 
                    element, and let $m$ and $n$ be integers such that $d = ma + nb$. That is, $d$ is the smallest 
                    positive linear combination of $a$ and $b$. We are going to verify that $d$ is the $gcd$ of $a$ and $b$, 
                    and this will prove the theorem.
                    <br>
                    Since $d\in{S}$, then $d \gt 0$: so $d$ is nonnegative and not equal to $0$. In order to prove that 
                    $d$ is the $gcd$ of $a$ and $b$, we have to prove that<br>
                    (i) $d | a$ and $d | b$;<br>
                    (ii) if $c | a$ and $c | b$, then $c | d$.<br>
                    If $a = 0$, $d|a$ is automatic. If $a \ne 0$, we can use division with remainder: 
                    by <a href="#theorem1.3">Theorem 1.3</a>, we know that there exist integers $q$ and $r$ such that $a = dq + r$, 
                    with $0 \le r \lt d$. What can we say about $r$? Note that
                    $$r = a - dq = a - (ma + nb) q = a (1 - mq) + b (-nq) :$$
                    this shows that $r$ is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$. Can it be an element of $S$? No! 
                    Because $r \lt d$, and $d$ has been chosen to be the smallest element of $S$. But then $r$ cannot 
                    be positive, since $r$ is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$, and $S$ contains all <i>positive</i> linear 
                    combinations of $a$ and $b$. Since $r \ge 0$ and $r$ is not positive, it follows that $r = 0$. 
                    This proves that $a = dq$, showing that $d|a$.
                    <br>
                    By essentially the same argument, we can deduce that $d|b$. This takes care of (i).
                    <br>
                    We still have to prove (ii). Suppose we have a common divisor $c$ of $a$ and $b$: $c|a$ and $c|b$. 
                    Then we have $a = uc, b = vc$ for some integers $u$ and $v$. This gives $$d = ma + nb = m (uc) + n (vc) = (mu + nv) c$$ 
                    and proves that $c|d$, as we needed.

                    Let $a, b, q, r$ be integers, with $b \ne 0$, and assume that $a = bq + r$. 
                    Then $gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r)$.

                    <i>Proof.</i><br>
                    It is enough to prove that the pairs $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $r$ have the same common divisors: 
                    then the largest among the common divisors will be the $gcd$ of both $(a, b)$ and $(b, r)$, proving the statement.
                    <br>
                    Let $c$ be a common divisor of $a$ and $b$: $c|a$ and $c|b$. Then $a = cs, b = ct$ for some integers $s$ and $t$. 
                    It follows that $$r = a - bq = cs - ctq = c (s - tq),$$
                    and this shows that $c|r$. Since we already have that $c|b$, we see that $c$ is a common divisor of $b$ and $r$.

                    By Lemma 1.15: $gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r_0) = gcd(r_0, r_1) = \dots = gcd(r_{n-1}, r_n) = gcd(r_n, 0) = r_n$.

                    If necessary, one can chase the Euclidean algorithm backwards and find integers $m, n$ such that $gcd(a, b) = ma + nb$.
