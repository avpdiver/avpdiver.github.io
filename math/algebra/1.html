                    "Divisibility" defines an order relation on the set of nonnegative integers. 
                    What Lemma 1.2 says is that, to some extent, this "new" order relation is compatible with the ordinary one $\le$.

                    <b>THEOREAM 1.2. (Division with remainder)</b> Let $a,b$ be integers, with $b\ne0$. 
                    Then there exist a unique $q\in\mathbb{Z}$ and a unique $r\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $a=bq+r$ with $0\le{r}\lt|b|$.
                </section>
                <section class="proof">
                    <i>Proof.</i> We can assume that $b\gt{0}$. 
                    Indeed, if $b\lt{0}$, we can apply the statement to $-b\gt{0}$ and then flip the sign of $q$ after the fact. 
                    Switching the sign of $b$ does not change $|b|$, so the condition on $r$ is unchanged.<br>
                    Assume then that $b\gt{0}$, and consider all integer linear combinations of $a$ and $b$ of the form $a-bx$ with $x\in\mathbb{Z}$. 
                    Note that there are nonnegative integers of this type: if $a$ is itself nonnegative, then $a-b\cdot0=a$ is nonnegative; 
                    and if $a$ is negative, then $a-ba=a(1-b)$ is nonnegative because $1-b\le0$. 
                    Therefore, the set $$S=\{a-bx\ |\ x\in\mathbb{Z}: a-bx\ge0\}$$ is a nonempty set of nonnegative integers.<br>
                    By the well-ordering principle, it contains a least element $r$: 
                    that is, there is some $x=q$ such that $r=a-bq\ge0$ is smaller than any other nonnegative number of the form $a-bx$. 
                    And these $q$ and $r$ are the unique numbers whose existence is claimed in the statement.<br>
                    Indeed: by construction we have that $a=bq+r$ and that $r\ge0$; 
                    we have to verify that (1) $r\lt{b}$ (note that $|b|=b$ since we are assuming $b\gt0$) and 
                    (2) the numbers $q$ and $r$ are unique with these properties.<br>
                    For (1), argue by contradiction. If we had $r\ge{b}$, then we would have $r-b\ge0$; and $$0\le{r-b}=(a-bq)-b=a-b(q+1).$$
                    This would show that $r-b$ is an element of $S$, since it is a nonnegative integer linear combination of $a$ and $b$. 
                    But that is a contradiction, since $r-b\lt{r}$ while $r$ was chosen to be the least element of $S$. 
                    Since $r\ge{b}$ leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that $r\lt{b}$ as we claimed.<br>
                    For (2), assume that $q',r'$ are also integers satisfying the requirement spelled out in the theorem: 
                    that is, $a=bq'+r'$, and $0\le{r'}\lt{b}$. 
                    We will show that necessarily $q'=q$ and $r'=r$ (this is what we mean by stating that $q$ and $r$ are "unique").<br>
                    Since $a=bq+r=bq'+r'$, we have $$b(q-q')=r'-r.\qquad\qquad\qquad(1.1)$$<br>
                    Now, since both $r$ and $r'$ are in the interval $[0, b-1]$, their difference cannot exceed $b-1$. 
                    In other words, $|r'-r|\le{b-1}$, and in particular $|r'-r|\lt|b|$. 
                    But (1.1) shows that $b$ is a divisor of $r'-r$; if $r'-r\ne0$, then by Lemma 1.2 we would necessarily have 
                    $|b|\le|r'-r|$, contradicting the fact that $|b|>|r'-r|$ we observed a moment ago. 
                    The only possibility then is that $r'-r=0$. This shows that $r'=r$, and further $b(q-q')=0$. 
                    Since $b\ne0$, this implies that $q-q'=0$, and it follows that $q'=q$.
