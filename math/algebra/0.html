                    <b>THEOREM 0.1. Division Algorithm.</b><br>
                    Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with $b \gt 0$. Then there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ with the 
                    property that $a = bq + r$, where $0 \le r \lt b$.
                </section>
                <section class="proof">
                    We begin with the existence portion of the theorem.
                    <br>
                    Consider the set $S = \{a - bk\ |\ k \in\mathbb{Z}, a - bk \ge 0\}$.
                    <br>
                    If $0 \in S$, then $b$ divides $a$ and we may obtain the desired result with $q = \frac{a}{b}$ and $r = 0$.
                    <br>
                    Now assume $0 \notin S$. Since $S$ is nonempty (if $a \gt 0, a - b \cdot 0 \in S$; if $a \lt 0, a - b(2a) = a(1 - 2b) \in S; a \ne 0$ since $0 \notin S$), 
                    we may apply the Well Ordering Principle to conclude that $S$ has a smallest member, say $r = a - bq$. 
                    Then $a = bq + r$ and $r \ge 0$, so all that remains to be proved is that $r \lt b$.
                    <br>
                    If $r \ge b$, then $a - b(q + 1) = a - bq - b = r - b \ge 0$, so that $a - b(q + 1) \in S$. 
                    But $a - b(q+1) \lt a - bq$, and $a - bq$ is the smallest member of $S$. So, $r \lt b$.
                    <br>
                    To establish the uniqueness of $q$ and $r$, let us suppose that there are integers $q, q', r, r'$ such that 
                    $$a = bq + r \qquad 0 \le r \lt b$$
                    $$a = bq' + r' \qquad 0 \le r' \lt b$$
                    For convenience, we may also suppose that $r \ge r'$. Then 
                    $$bq + r = bq' + r' \implies b(q - q') = r - r'.$$
                    So, $b$ <b>divides</b> $r - r'$ and $r - r' \lt b$ ($0 \le r - r' \le r \lt b$). 
                    It follows that $r - r' = 0$, and therefore $r = r'$ and $q = q'$.

                    <b>THEOREM 0.2. GCD is a Linear Combination.</b><br>
                    For any nonzero integers $a$ and $b$, there exist integers $s$ and $t$ such that $gcd(a, b) = s \cdot a + t \cdot b$.
                    <br>
                    Moreover, $gcd(a, b)$ is the smallest positive integer of the form $s \cdot a + t \cdot b$.
                </section>
                <section class="proof">
                    Consider the set $S = \{ma + nb \ | \ m, n \in\mathbb{Z}, ma + nb \gt 0\}$. Since $S$ is obviously nonempty 
                    (if some choice of $m$ and $n$ makes $ma + nb \lt 0$, then replace $m$ and $n$ by $-m$ and $-n$), 
                    the Well Ordering Principle asserts that $S$ has a smallest member, say, $d = sa + tb$. We claim that $d = gcd(a, b)$.
                    <br>
                    To verify this claim, use the division algorithm to write $a = dq + r$, where $0 \le r \lt d$. 
                    If $r \gt 0$, then $r = a - dq = a - (sa + tb)q = a - saq - tbq = (1 - sq)a + (-tq)b \in S$, 
                    contradicting the fact that $d$ is the smallest member of $S$. So, $r = 0 \implies a = dq$ and $d$ divides $a$.
                    <br>
                    Analogously (or, better yet, by symmetry), $d$ divides $b$ as well. This proves that $d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$.
                    <br>
                    Now suppose $d'$ is another common divisor of $a$ and $b$ and write $a = d'h$ and $b = d'k$. 
                    Then $d = sa + tb = s(d'h) + t(d'k) = d'(sh + tk)$, so that $d'$ is a divisor of $d$. 
                    Thus, among all common divisors of $a$ and $b$, $d$ is the greatest.

                    If $p$ is a prime that divides $ab$, then $p$ divides $a$ or $p$ divides $b$:
                    $$p|ab \implies p|a \lor p|b$$
                </section>
                <section class="proof">
                    Suppose $p$ is a prime that divides $ab$ but does not divide $a$. 
                    We must show that $p$ divides $b$. 
                    Since $p$ does not divide $a$, there are integers $s$ and $t$ such that $1 = sa + tp$:
                    $$1 = sa + tp \implies b \cdot 1 = b \cdot (sa + tp) \implies b = bsa + btp = (ab)s + (bt)p.$$
                    Since $p|ab$ by the condition of the lemma then $p$ divides the right-hand side of last equation, what means $p$ also divides $b$.
